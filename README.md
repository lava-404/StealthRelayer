A privacy-focused payment protocol for Solana that combines stealth addresses, transaction relaying, and gas abstraction to enable private transfers without exposing a recipient's primary wallet address on-chain.

StealthPay allows recipients to publish a reusable meta-address while senders generate unique one-time destination addresses for every payment. A relayer infrastructure handles transaction broadcasting and fee sponsorship, creating a smoother and more private payment experience.

## What It Does

Traditional Solana payments expose a recipient's public wallet address.

StealthPay introduces a privacy layer where:

* Recipients generate a Meta Address
* Senders derive a unique one-time Stealth Address
* Every payment goes to a different destination address
* Recipients can recover ownership of the funds
* Relayers can sponsor transaction fees

```text
Recipient  ->  Meta Address  ->  Sender   ->  Stealth Address Generation   ->  Relayer   ->  Solana Network
```

---

## Motivation

Most blockchain transactions are fully transparent.

Anyone can:

* Track wallet balances
* Link multiple transactions together
* Monitor payment activity
* Build transaction histories

StealthPay reduces wallet traceability by generating a unique destination address for every payment while preserving the recipient's ability to recover and spend the funds.

---

## Features

### Stealth Address Generation

Recipients create a Meta Address consisting of:

```text
Public View Key
Public Spend Key
```

Senders use the Meta Address and an ephemeral keypair to derive a unique destination address.

```text
Meta Address
      +
Ephemeral Key
      ↓
Stealth Address
```

Every transfer results in a different address.

---

### ECDH-Based Shared Secret Derivation

The protocol uses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) over Curve25519.

```text
Sender:
r × A

Recipient:
a × R
```

Both parties derive the same shared secret independently.

---

### One-Time Payment Addresses

Each payment generates:

```text
R = Ephemeral Public Key
P = Stealth Public Key
```

Result:

```text
Payment 1 → Address A
Payment 2 → Address B
Payment 3 → Address C
```

Even when sent to the same recipient.

---

### Memo-Based Key Discovery

The sender publishes the ephemeral public key inside a Solana Memo instruction.

Recipients scan transaction memos to discover stealth payments intended for them.

```text
Transaction
    ├── Transfer
    └── Memo (Ephemeral Public Key)
```

---

### Relayer Infrastructure

A relayer service validates transactions before broadcasting them.

Responsibilities include:

* Transaction validation
* Fee payment verification
* Fee sponsorship
* Transaction broadcasting

```text
User
  │
  ▼
Relayer
  │
  ▼
Solana
```

---

### Payment Detection

Recipients can scan transactions and determine whether a payment belongs to them.

The detection flow:

```text
Read Memo   ->  Recover Ephemeral Key   ->  Derive Shared Secret   ->   Reconstruct Expected Address   ->  Match Found
```

## Architecture

Frontend (Next.js)   ->  Axum API   ->  Stealth Engine   ->  Relayer    ->  Solana
```

## Backend Endpoints

### Health Check

```http
GET /health
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

---

### Create Meta Address

```http
POST /meta-address/create
```

Generates a new recipient meta-address.

---

### Send Stealth Payment

```http
POST /send
```

Builds a stealth transaction from a recipient's meta-address.

---

### Relay Transaction

```http
POST /relay
```

Validates and broadcasts transactions through the relayer.

---

### Scan Payments

```http
GET /payments
```

Scans transactions for stealth payments intended for a recipient.

## Running the Project

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stealthpay.git

cd stealthpay
```

---

## Start Backend

```bash
cd backend

cargo build

cargo run
```

Backend starts on:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

pnpm install

pnpm run dev
```

Frontend starts on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Local Development

Run both services:

```text
Frontend → http://localhost:3000

Backend  → http://localhost:8080
```

The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP API endpoints.
